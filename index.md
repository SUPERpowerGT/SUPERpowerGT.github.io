# Hey bro，look at me！

Hello my bro,nice to meet you!

 I will keep my study notes and some miscellaneous things so that this blog is called ***UTILITY ROOM***.

I really hope you find something and it will be the biggest encouragement to me.

### Preface

Talk about why I set up my own blog thanks to my dear seniors and roommates. Even though it took me half a day to put together a spliced blog. Anyway, it was a success HHH. I hope to work hard on the rest of my code journey.
